<h1> About Us</h1>

<h2> In Robotics club </h2>
<p>
Part of what we do is build robots, repair robots, code, raise money for our team, alongside with many other things. The focus of Robotics club is working towards
the goal of winning championship at the Fright Frenzie robotics competition. Our purpose is to explore new things in the world of software and hardware, expand our skills, and help our teammates in their robotics journey. 
<br>
<br>
Before our current journey, only about 6 people would show up to competitions but each one had their own role and we did it well. During the "Rover Ruckus" competition we were able to pull through with a preliminary win which was a greay accomplishment for us and we tried to keep that same level of deducation even after we lost our next competition.
<br>
<br>
We come together twice a week to discuss ideas and opinions on how to improve our robot in order to be able to get ready and win the Freight Frezie competition. We are located at a high school in The Bronx, New York.

<h2> Personal Statements </h2>
<p>
I’m joining robotics this year because I’m interested in coding. I enjoyed it last year in my Digital Design class. I didn’t join in the past because I was in other clubs that took place during the same time as the robotics club. I’m willing to do anything the team needs me to because I am a fast learner and have the basic experience that’s required. - Neeha

<br>
I decided to join robotics this year because I had the chance to experience some of it last year in 11th grade and I wanted to expand further on that. We were limited to certain stuff and in robotics I can explore more of it. I wasn’t able to join before because I was involved with other extracurriculars that took place at the same time.- Dulce
<br>
<br>
This year I have decided to join Robotics because when we had digital design that was one of the classes I actually looked forward to. I enjoyed making projects and web pages. The one I liked the most was making our own business. I hope to expand my knowledge on coding and making websites by joining this club. I was previously involved with other clubs so I could not join, but I have the time this year.  - Genesis

<h2> What is it Like Working With Seniors? </h2>
<p>
The team this year is all familiar since we have all been acquainted with one another since freshman year.
